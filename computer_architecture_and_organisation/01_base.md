# Von Neumann Architecture (冯·诺依曼架构)：
Also called Princeton Architecture (普林斯顿架构), this architecture is the foundation of most modern computers. It consists of the following main components:
- ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit, 算术逻辑单元): Responsible for performing arithmetic and logical operations.
- CU (Control Unit, 控制单元): Directs the operation of the processor by interpreting instructions from memory.
- Memory (存储器): Stores data and instructions that the CPU needs to execute.
- Input/Output (I/O, 输入/输出): Interfaces for communication between the computer and the external world.
- Buses (总线): Communication pathways that transfer data between the components of the computer.
# Harvard Architecture (哈佛架构)：
In contrast to the Von Neumann architecture, the Harvard architecture has separate memory spaces for instructions and data. This allows for simultaneous access to both instruction and data memory, which can improve performance. It is commonly used in embedded systems and digital signal processing.
# Stored Program Concept (存储程序概念)：
This concept, proposed by John von Neumann, states that instructions (programs) should be stored in memory alongside data. This allows the CPU to fetch and execute instructions sequentially from memory, enabling more complex and flexible computing.
